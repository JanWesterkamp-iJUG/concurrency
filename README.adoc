= Jakarta Concurrency
:toc: auto

== Introduction

Jakarta Concurrency provides a specification document, API and TCK for using concurrency from application components without compromising container integrity while still preserving the Jakarta EE platform's fundamental benefits.
The EE4J project that implements this api is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/concurrency-ri).

This project is part of the overall Jakarta EE platform and is a project within the Eclipse EE4J Project. Please see the [Eclipse EE4J Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j) for details of the Top Level project.
